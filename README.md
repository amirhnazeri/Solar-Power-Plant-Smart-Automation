Abstract:
Renwable energy is the main answer to the world's growing need for energy in the near future, and solar power plants are an efficient pillar in this cycle. In the recent years, electrical engineers have sought ways to monitor the performance and errors of solar power plants online in order to minimize potential damage in addition to saving on monitoring costs and preventing declining solar panel efficiency. Large-scale solar power plants use a large number of dc to ac inverters to convert and distribute input power, which is eventually aggregated and transferred to the national grid. Online and Real-Time monitoring of all inverters in decentralized power plants is very vital to ensure the correct operation, in this regard, detecting possible faults using modern artificial intelligence methods and designing a monitoring system with a suitable graphical interface and in accordance with the needs of power plants has a significant impact on improving monitoring and increasing the efficiency of these power plants.
In the solar power plant intelligent monitoring system, the data are received from the power plant component sensors, which is sent through data exchange modules, for accurate, safe and secure monitoring and using a graphical interface and a combination of state-of-art artificial intelligence methods to detect possible faults are provided to the user.
